# Anicat
## Introduction
Anicat is a programming language written in Rust, supporting features like static typing.

## Why Rust?
As we know, all the popular programming languages with `virtual machine` are all written in C/C++. However, C/C++ has some memory-safe problems. A virtual machine wriiten in Rust can prevent such problems.

## Features
* Static typping
* Compling-time memory management
* Cross platform
* Register-based virtual machine

## Universal VM
It sounds like JVM or WASI, right? But JVM isn't a low-level VM, and WebAssembly is a 32bit VM, we aimed to develop a universal and low-level VM that can run on every platform.
